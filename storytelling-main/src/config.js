Prior to the riot, the city was not yet rigidly segregated. After the riot, the boundaries between Black and white Chicago were sharply drawn and fiercely defended. Historian Adam Green has observed that police responded to the public emergency of the riot by establishing a cordon around the Black Belt—the “first citywide example of differential policing.” An emergency measure in the midst of the race war, policing as containment soon became normalized.',

CHA called in the police to quell tensions, but they proved incapable of managing the hostilities. Even after 700 police officers were stationed for months at the Trumbull Park site, the first Black family to move in gave up and moved out. Although the police were ineffective at promoting integration, these events solidified the relationship between the CHA and local police forces. Going forward, police were seen as the central tool for managing and controlling public housing residents.',

By the 1980s, the Chicago Police Department (CPD) had established specific beats to patrol public housing, as well as tactics such as “vertical patrols,” in which groups of police officers would walk floor-to-floor in the high-rises. Officers were supported by pervasive surveillance technologies, including CCTV cameras and hidden wires, making CHA developments among the most heavily surveilled sites in the city. Rather than provide social services to alleviate conditions of extreme poverty, policing of crime became the primary vehicle for exercising social control. At the same time, residents complained that officers often did not respond to calls when needed and were ineffective at stopping or solving crimes. Many complained of regular disrespect, abuse, and violence by officers.',

Building an in-house police force expanded CHA’s law enforcement function, making it both landlord and police. CHA Police officers—numbering about 500 at the force’s height—had full powers of arrest in CHA developments and worked out of sub-stations within several of the complexes, complete with lock-up facilities. Together, CPD and the CHA police officers conducted unconstitutional raids of public housing buildings, ransacking apartments before dawn. In short, the CHA Police force drained federal monies otherwise earmarked for building maintenance, while making public housing into an ever-more prison-like space—one where all residents were treated as criminals and presumed guilty until proven innocent.',

In 1992, 7-year-old Dantrell Davis was shot and killed by a stray bullet at Cabrini-Green. Although not the first child to die by such random violence in public housing, Davis’ death prompted an unprecedented media maelstrom and sparked widespread public outrage. In the wake of his death, policymakers argued that crime and violence in public housing were intolerable and, implicitly, that they were beyond what policing alone could control. Over time, these arguments would serve other ends: a growing movement to demolish and replace public housing.',

After several years of federal management, it was announced in 1999 that the city would resume control of the CHA and would launch what it called the “Plan for Transformation,” an ambitious effort to demolish all of the city’s high-rises and replace them with privately-owned and managed mixed-income communities. The CHA Police were disbanded, and policing of CHA developments became the sole responsibility of CPD, which created a new unit for the purpose. Under the agreement between the city and HUD, CHA was granted a “Moving to Work” (MTW) designation—a privilege usually reserved for high-performing housing authorities that allows more flexibility in the use of federal funds—despite the fact that CHA had been deemed “failing” just four years prior.',

CHA ceased turning over vacant units, slowing shutting down entire floors and then entire buildings. Thus, the resident population began to decline, despite the massive demand for housing as reflected in the city’s decades-long public housing waitlist. This artificial production of vacancy was used by CHA as a rationale for reducing the number of units it was responsible for replacing—from 42,000 units at CHA’s height, to the 25,000 units that were promised in the Plan. Some high-rises became de facto homeless shelters, as homeless families squatted in vacant units until evicted—a clear reflection of human need that was being unaddressed.',

As buildings emptied out in the early 2000s, police increasingly focused on the shadow play of narcotics enforcement rather than protecting public housing residents. Although CHA still transferred money to the police department for supplemental services (over $161 million between 2000 and 2012), police were allowed to operate with little oversight in an increasingly hollowed-out landscape, leaving remaining residents extremely vulnerable to corrupt officers such as former CPD Sergeant Ronald Watts. Between the late 1990s and 2012, Watts and his tactical team operated a protection racket, extorting a “tax” from drug dealers in the Ida B. Wells Homes as the buildings were slowly demolished around them. Watts and his conspirators planted evidence and fabricated drug and gun charges, resulting in the wrongful incarceration of hundreds of public housing tenants. Watts and his partner, former Officer Kallat Mohammed, were ultimately caught in an FBI sting in 2011 and convicted on a single charge of stealing government property, for which they received sentences of 22 months and 18 months, respectively. To date, 183 Watts’ victims have been exonerated, with victims collectively serving more than 450 years in prison.',

Today, fewer than 7,000 units of traditional public housing remain, while some 44,000 people are on the CHA waitlist for public housing and another 35,000 people are on the voucher waitlist.
